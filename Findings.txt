Findings
================================================================

1. VPN Encryption Features
--------------------------
- ProtonVPN uses strong encryption protocols (e.g. OpenVPN, WireGuard) to secure every packet.
- Data is encrypted using AES-256 (Advanced Encryption Standard), which is considered military-grade and unbreakable by current technology.
- Keys are exchanged securely using protocols such as RSA, ensuring only the VPN server and client can decrypt data.
- Encryption is end-to-end between you and the VPN server, protecting your information even on insecure public Wi-Fi.
- All DNS queries are also tunneled and encrypted, reducing risk of DNS leaks.

2. Privacy Features
-------------------
- VPN masks your real IP address, making it appear as if you are browsing from the VPN server location (e.g. New York, USA, instead of India).
- VPN hides internet activity from ISPs, public Wi-Fi providers, or local attackers.
- ProtonVPN maintains a strict no-logs policy (does not monitor or store activity).
- Kill switch and DNS leak protection settings help prevent accidental data exposure if the VPN disconnects.
- Split tunneling allows only certain apps/sites to use the VPN, keeping others on the local network for convenience.

3. VPN Benefits Summary
-----------------------
- Provides encrypted tunnel for all network traffic, enhancing data security.
- Prevents eavesdropping, especially on public or untrusted networks (cafés, airports, colleges).
- Masks real IP, allowing access to geo-restricted services and protecting location privacy.
- Reduces tracking by advertisers/websites via changing server locations or hiding true identity.
- Protects sensitive information, logins, and private communications from interception.

4. VPN Limitations Summary
--------------------------
- VPN speed may be slower due to encryption overhead and server distance.
- User must trust the VPN provider, since they can technically see all tunneled traffic (choose a reputable one with no-logs policy).
- Does not prevent malware infections, phishing, or compromise of user devices themselves.
- Some services block known VPN IPs (e.g. streaming or banking sites).
- VPN does not provide absolute anonymity: browser/device fingerprinting and account logins can still leak user identity.

5. Observed Results
-------------------
- Screenshots confirm real IP was hidden and browsing traffic fully encrypted while VPN was connected.
- Wikipedia and other sites loaded without issue—connection stability unaffected.
- Disconnecting the VPN immediately restored the original IP and local network status.
- ProtonVPN was easy to install, configure, and provided robust security features out-of-the-box.
